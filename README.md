![Build](https://github.com/omarmiatello/brother-label-printer-kt/workflows/Pre%20Merge%20Checks/badge.svg)

Kotlin extensions for "[Brother Print SDK for Android](https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/dev/en/mobilesdk/android/index.html?c=eu_ot&lang=en&navi=offall&comple=on&redirect=on)" (supported models MPring, PocketJet, and RJ/TD/QL/PT series) - Tested on Brother QL-820NWB

## Setup

Add this in your `build.gradle.ktx` file:
```kotlin
// **Version: Brother Print SDK for Android‚Ñ¢ ver.3.5.1**
// Could be downloaded here: https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/dev/en/mobilesdk/android/index.html?c=eu_ot&lang=en&navi=offall&comple=on&redirect=on
implementation(project(":BrotherPrintLibrary"))

implementation("com.github.omarmiatello.brother-label-printer-kt:core:1.0.1")
```

## How to use

Note:
- Brother Mobile SDK support only one device at a time.
- `com.brother.ptouch.sdk.Printer`, internally use a lot of static methods (and yes, it's a bad practice)

Step 1) Initialize onCreate() of your Application/Activity
```kotlin
BrotherManager.init(context)
```

Step 2) Listen for a printer
```kotlin
// OPTION 1: this search for the first printer available
val printer: StateFlow<PrinterState> = BrotherManager.setDeviceOrSearch()

// OPTION 2: this search for a specific printer of use search as fallback if the printer is not available at start
val printer: StateFlow<PrinterState> = BrotherManager.setDeviceOrSearch(
    SearchNetPrinter(
        model = PrinterInfo.Model.QL_820NWB,
        ip = "192.168.86.182",
    )
)
```

Step 3) Print using a template
```kotlin
fun printTemplate(easyPrinter: EasyPrinter) {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        easyPrinter.printTemplate(
            templateId = 4,
            data = mapOf(
                "title" to "This is a test",
                "qr" to "My QR Code",
            ),
        )
    }
}
```
